1. A class defines a an object and its methods and properties while an object is an instantiation of the class.
2. A member variable belongs to the instantiation of the class while a regualr variable is just part of the file.
3. member functions beling to the instantiation of the class and regular functions don't belong to a class. Member functions require self argument to represent it belongs to the class. 
4. Inheritance expresses the one to many.
5. Constructor initializes the object with or without some initiial properties.
6. __init__, once.
7. pointlist = [] 
for x in range(10):
	for y in range(10):
		point = Point2D(x,y)
		pointlist.append(point)
8. def print(self, x, y):
	string = '(' + string(x) + ', ' + string(y) + ')'
9. class MyPoint2D:
	def __init__(self, x=0.0, y=0.0):
		Point2D.__init__(self,x,y)
